-Start to use branching to familiarize ourselves and to have a better workflow

-latest commit: implemented until collision update

# NOTE

- game is set so when the player collides with the pipe(?), the game freezes/stops scrolling and updating and that is intentional for now
- would like to change the player sprite a bit to resemble more of a rectangle because collisions don't look fair. you could test it out to see what i mean hehe
